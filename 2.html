<h1>HTML</h1>
  <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
  <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
  Heading tags have influence when it comes to ranking in Google. Though it doesn’t matter to Google, I stick to one ‘H1’ on the page and use headings ‘H2’, ‘H3′ were appropriate. Keep headings in order.Avoid using headings for design elements. Write naturally with keywords in Headings if relevant. Avoid keyword stuffing.
  Simple handling of H tags is often more manageable than ‘optimal’ and a lot easier to achieve with most of the benefits, and there is often no exact way to treat any specific SEO element in every instance.</p>
  <p>Read on for a more detailed explanation of how I handle headings from H1 to H6 on a web page, and why I only use 1 H1 on a normal web page unless I am specifically asked to do something different, or am working with a very bespoke HTML document.
  I keep the phrase in Page Title Tags and H1 tags identical these days.</P>
